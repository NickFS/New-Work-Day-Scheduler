# New-Work-Day-Scheduler

 The New Work Day Scheduler provides the user the ability to save events for each hour of the day. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether an event is set in the past, present, or future. When the save button for each timeblock is triggered, the text input for that event is saved in local storage.
